  "SavedGameOutdatedDescription1": "You can keep this save game, and play it. However, we recommend that you start a new game. Since this game was started, Subnautica's world has been significantly expanded. New caves, regions, and landmarks have been added. This saved game does not include all that cool new terrain.

  If you choose to keep playing this saved game, it will be upgraded. This upgrade may insert new terrain across vast areas that were previously empty sandy expanses. The upgrade does not provide all new terrain, and we still recommend starting an entirely new game.",
  "SavedGameOutdatedDescription2": "The upgrade will cause the destruction of any seabases, submarines, or equipment located in or close to an upgraded area. Any of your stuff located outside an upgraded area will not be affected.",

  "SavedGameOutdatedUpgrade": "Upgrade and Load Game",
  "Cancel": "Cancel",
  "TerrainSystemInformationHeader": "Terrain System Information",
  "TerrainSystemInformationText": "Subnautica uses a voxel terrain system that stores information in batches. Each batch is a 160m wide cube, and the world is made up of about 12,500 of them.

  The development team is constantly working on these batches. New caves are carved, ravines cut out, Kelp Forests planted, and rock formations sculpted.

  Subnautica is updated frequently. If Experimental branch is played, it is updated three times per day! Saved games need to work across multiple game versions. Otherwise, as soon as the development team released an update, the saved game would be lost.

  Most saved game information can survive an update. For example, an inventory containing two oxygen tanks can survive if a new type of craftable diving suit is added to the game.

  Other information can't survive an update. For example, suppose a seabase is built on a cliff, and suppose the development team works on the batch containing that cliff, raising the cliff height.

  If that save game is loaded, the seabase will be stuck inside the cliff. Not only will the base be inaccessible, but the player might be stuck in there too, and all hell will break loose inside Subnautica's game logic.

  To solve this problem, every saved game retains its own copy of terrain data. This data stores the world as it was when that game was started, along with any modifications made by a player (For example, digging sand to create a cave).

  As new updates are released, the saved game receives new features, items, creatures, and so on. But it never receives new terrain. This is often ok. In the case of major updates, it is not.

  New game systems and items included in this update depend on the data contained in new terrain batches. If a an old saved game tries to play current version, it will not work properly and might even crash Subnautica completely.

  This is why old saved games must be upgraded to play the game. Therefore some terrain batches are forced to update, allowing the new update to function. Any stuff (such as seabases) placed in these batches is destroyed by this process, to avoid the stuck-in-a-cliff scenario described above.

  However, the upgrade is not perfect. Depending on specific circumstances, it is possible that gaps could open up in terrain, or systems fail to function perfectly. In addition, the ugprade does not include all the new terrain data from the rest of the world.

  To play with an entirely up to date world, it is necessary to start a new game. The choice is yours. Regardless of your choice, thank you for participating in Subnautica Early Access. You are quite literally watching an alien ocean world grow before your eyes. This saved game upgrade process is a prime example of that growth.",

  Yes. You can run Subnautica on any computer on which your Steam account is logged in. Subnautica is tied to a Steam account, not a particular computer.",
  "MinSpecAnswer1": "Can I get a refund? My computer does not meet these requirements.

  Because Subnautica is sold via Steam, Steam has absolute and sole discretion over the issue of refunds. Unknown Worlds cannot issue refunds, or intervene on your behalf with Steam.",
  "MinSpecAnswer2": "How was I supposed to know about these requirements?

  Subnautica has minimum and recommended system requirements listed on its Steam Store page.",
  "MinSpecAnswer3": "Are these system requirements really high?

  Subnautica's minumum system requirements are not high. The minimum GPU requirement is lower than a modern game console's.",
  "MinSpecAnswer4": "What happens if I try to play Subnautica despite this warning?

  Subnautica might run just fine. It might crash as soon as it tries to load the game world. We're not sure what exactly will happen for individual cases, but it is very likely Subnautica will run slowly and / or crash.",
  "MinSpecAnswer5": "Will these system requirements ever drop?

  It is unlikely Subnautica's minimum system requirements will drop lower than they are at present.",
  "MinSpecMemoryInfoHeader": "More info - Memory",
  "MinSpecMemoryInfoText": "Computers generally have two types of memory - Volatile memory, commonly called Random Access Memory (RAM), and non-volatile memory in the form of disk drives.

  Disk drives store files and folders, and RAM stores what a computer is thinking about. Subnautica needs four gigabytes (GB) of RAM to be able to think about all the creatures, terrain, physics, and gameplay found in the game world. Without 4 GB of RAM, Subnautica can't think properly, and will crash.

  It is not possible to get more RAM using software tools. Freeing space on your disk drive by deleting files and folders will not make more RAM available. To get more RAM, it is necessary to install more or higher capacity RAM modules in your computer.

  Depending on what type of computer you have, this may or may not be possible. For example, it is often very hard to install more RAM in a laptop. You may be able to contact your computer manufacturer and ask them if it is possible to upgrade your computer.

  If you would like to learn more about RAM, and how to get more of it, try opening a discussion on the support forums. Other players may be able to help you!",
  "MinSpecOpenSupoprtForums": "Open Support Forums",

  "MinSpecGPUInfoHeader": "More info - GPU",
  "MinSpecGPUInfoText": "Computers use Graphics Processing Units (GPU) to turn information about Subnautica's game world into pixels that you can see on your screen. They are often known as 'Graphics Cards.'

  It is hard to define exactly what type of GPU is required to run Subnautica, because they come in many different varieties, and are identified with many different brand names.

  Generally, a GPU that scores more than 950 points in the 3DMark Firestrike benchmark test will be capable of running Subnautica with minimum graphics settings, at a resolution of 1280 x 720.

  If Subnautica has detected that your GPU is not powerful enough, you may still be able to play. However, your frame-rate (the speed at which the game runs) may be very poor. Depending on the type of computer you have, you may be able to upgrade your GPU.

  To find out more about GPUs, and to determine if this computer's GPU can be upgraded, try opening a discussion thread on the Support forums.",
  "MinSpecGPUDetected": "GPU Detected:",
  "MinSpecCPUInfoHeader": "More info - CPU",
  "MinSpecCPUInfoText": "Central Processing Units (CPUs) make calculations that determine what is going on in Subnautica's game world. For example, they calculate the buoyancy of the Life Pod, and the position of each individual Peeper fish.

  CPUs think in 'threads,' which are like 'trains of thought.' The number of thoughts that a CPU can think at once is determined by the number of logical processors it has.

  CPUs can have multiple logical processors by having more than one 'core' - a piece of hardware that executes threads. They can split those cores into multiple threads. For example, many Intel CPUs use a technique called 'Hyper Threading.'

  However the CPU goes about having more than one logical processor, Subnautica needs at least two of them to run properly. If this computer has less than two logical processors, it is very likely that it will run poorly and crash.

  Sometimes CPUs can be upgraded. To determine if this computer can be upgraded, try opening a discussion thread on the Support forums.",

  The furthest reaches of inhabited space are due to expand, as Alterra Corp launches a newly-constructed capital ship, carrying a phasegate bound for the Ariadne Arm.

  The Aurora will travel from spacedock on the edge of Alterra space, making hundreds of consecutive phasegate jumps through nine different trans-gov authorities, and arrive on the far side of the Ariadne Arm in three months' time. From there the command crew will pilot the ship beyond the final phasegate, arriving in the next solar system approximately 18 months later.

  There the elite team of engineers will begin a 6 month construction project on the new phasegate, a multi-trillion credit investment. In the absence of existing infrastructure in the region, the vessel is equipped with advanced thermal and nuclear power facilities.

  Alterra Corp. currently operates 9% of all phasegates in the galaxy. If the Aurora's mission is successful Alterra will have outmanoeuvered a cabal of Mongolian corporations, operating a range of outposts and mines in the region.",

- Target: Crew of the Mongolian vessel 'Degasi'
- Last known position: Vicinity of planet 4546B, Ariadne Arm
- Contact: Mongolian Emissary Jochi Khasar, Aurora Passenger Quarters

Mission brief:
A Mongolian vessel, the 'Degasi', disappeared almost a decade ago, carrying with it a high ranking Mongolian chief. Corporate insurance has purchased passage aboard the Aurora for Emissary Khasar, and your orders are to make every reasonable effort to locate and retrieve the Degasi crewmembers, without compromising the primary mission. Confirming the fate of the crew will aid Alterra's diplomatic efforts with the Mongolian councils.

Mission Details:
- Aurora is due to perform a slingshot maneuver around 4546B (category 3 ocean planet) approximately 13 months post-launch
- This will bring the ship within range of the Degasi's last known position
- Additional aquatic and all-terrain vehicles have been included in the Aurora's cargo package for this mission
- Degasi crew manifesto has been distributed to senior employees in a separate message",

"EncyDesc_Aurora_Living_Area_PDA1" : " - One of largest suppliers of spacefaring technologies and consumer electronics in the federation
- The official supplier of the TSF
- Consistently ranked amongst the Galaxy's best employers
- Began life as a defense manufacturer in the mid-22nd century
- National Motto: 'Get what you deserve'

Although most trans-govs can trace their roots back to earth, Alterra - literally meaning 'by earth' - is the only one brazen enough to take its name.

During the Expansion, Alterra supplied arms to all sides, acquiring and housing a vast colonist workforce, and making the transition from manufacturer to coprorate state. Alterra's threat to cease trade was one of the turning points in the conflict, bringing about the end of hostilities and the signing of the Charter.

Today Alterra has a ban on all weapons within its borders, although loopholes exist for law enforcement officers and manufacturers / exporters. The corporation has learnt that violence is most profitable when conducted between customers rather than employees.

Free enterprise within Alterra space is encouraged, but competition is tight, and all goods exported offworld must be Alterra branded. Profitable businesses are bought out by the state, owners ascending to the Alterra Board of Directors. Well-known Alterra technologies such as the Cyclops submersible originated with such private enterprises.

Despite superficial similarities to national governments, the corporation's lawyers have always maintained that it has no legal obligation to its 'employees', but voluntarily elects to take on the roles usually served by a democratically elected government. This claim has not yet been tested in Federation courts.",

All the good things in life are commodities. We trade love just as we buy and sell stock. We engage in human relationships when there is a fair exchange of value. Support, motivation, affection - nothing good is ever free.

If every physical good in the federation came from a single supplier it would constitute a dangerous monopoly. Personal relationships are the same: it is important for people to get what they need from multiple sources. If a person finds a better source of the goods they require, they are not wronging their original supplier by changing their purchasing arrangements.

If one member of a relationship should feel threatened or jealous, they must look at their own business model and ask whether it is performing competitively. There is always room for improvement.",

"EncyDesc_InnerBiomeWreckLore4" : "Frank told us this: 'I hear there are worlds out there where kids still learn from books. They go into a classroom every day, they memorize things, then later they type those things out in controlled environments. Or worlds where everyone's supposed to whatever creative job they feel like! What use is learning to draw or sing in a world where there's no human resource department to co-ordinate the galleries and concerts? On Alterra worlds, psychometric testing and specialized digi-training makes the most of everyone's talents.'

Max Zoinkoff: 'I started out in marketing for Alterra Survival Systems. It was good work, but I thought I could do better. I set up my own company, developing bespoke code for the Seamoth so it could operate in open space, not just underwater. I sold up to Alterra ten years ago and now it's one of the most widely used vehicles in the galaxy. Now I'm on the board of directors, and I haven't looked back.'

George said, 'An average day for me starts at 10am. I live in a controlled habitat on Terra 17, so everything I need is less than five minutes away. I'm a naturally empathetic person, so I took work as a companion. I spend my days visiting clients, talking with them, learning about them, paying them the attention that everyone needs and deserves, and like most people on Alterra worlds I'm lucky enough to earn a living doing things I enjoy.'

Kaz says, 'We're lucky. We're free. We have jobs. There are trans-govs out there that do everything with robots, or where weapons are legal, you know?'

Jamie had this to say: 'I design artificial worlds, including some of the most popular factory defaults. To do what I do you need to know what people really want. They want excitement, adventure, new experiences, to be whoever they want to be. My job is to make that happen. There are people who say we spend too much time escaping our lives and not enough time making them better. Those people are usually from outside of Alterra space.'",


"Ency_InnerBiomeWreckLore5" : "Trans-Gov Profile: Mongolian Independent States",
"EncyDesc_InnerBiomeWreckLore5" : "When the hostilities of the Expansion ceased, the tactical value of the hard-to-reach colony systems on the edge of the China Territories plummeted. Recouping from the war, the central government left them to starve. The systems in question declared independence, claiming their infrastructure as their own, and their intent to become self-sufficient.

Today the Mongolian States is seen as a relatively minor power on the outskirts of colonized space, yet it remains one of the fastest expanding trans-govs in the galaxy. There is little centralized control. In times of war, a defense force can be raised between the chief officers of the major planetary clan-corps.

Mongolian societies inherited their technologies from the Chinese, but incorporated the customs of their multicultural colonist base. Non-synthetic foods remain popular. Religion is a strong component of society, but the Mongolians take a relaxed view of competing faiths, believing gods to be universally and equally flawed. Mongolians will often be heard proclaiming, 'I believe in gods, so long as they don't try to command me.' If pushed to explain how they can believe in a god with no authority they will explain, simply, that all people are gods, and their authority is equally zero.",

Determinism teaches us that what has always been, always will be. The future is already decided, and free will is a myth. Gone are the days of casting guilt and original sin on all. Today we understand that we are born innocent, into lives we are not responsible for; we are atoms vibrating in the energy winds of space. Understanding that what we do has no meaning but for ourselves; and understanding that we are just as much a causal part of the universe as the universe is a causal part of us; we can understand that we give meaning to the universe and the universe gives meaning to us. We are people. But we are also gods.

If we are gods, why do we feel imperfect? If there is no authority but our own, why do people keep telling us what to do?

"Ency_OuterBiomeWreckLore4" : "What Can We Learn From the Hive Mind of Strader VI?",
"EncyDesc_OuterBiomeWreckLore4" : "How are the 'individuals' which make up a hive mind to be categorized? Are they merely dumb components of the larger, intelligent organism; or is the larger 'mind' merely a product of the independent organisms? Can it be both?

We define organisms by their traits, but find invariably that these traits depend on those of their environment. The concept of a tadpole is meaningless without the concept of the frog it will develop into. The idea of a predator is empty without an understanding of its prey. This begs the question: if we define everything by reference to everything else, what are have we actually explained?

An illustrative experiment was recently performed on the hive mind colony discovered on Strader VI. A device was placed outside the nest which would electrocute individuals approaching it. An ant colony would have lost many individuals before a basic danger signal was successfully communicated between them, resulting in 'learnt' avoidance of the device. Successful, but costly.

The Strader VI colony quickly formed into three factions:
- One attempted to move the device by brute force, sacrificing individuals as they did so
- The second attempted to cover the device in sand.

These two goals being mutually exclusive, a fight ensued. The first faction was beaten, in virtue of their reduced numbers. The device was safely buried, and the survivors called a truce. From the perspective of the individuals, this experience must have been horrific. From the perspective of the hive mind, a nagging problem had been overcome with the most effective solution. Which perspective is the 'correct' one?

I suggest that it is neither. By attempting to fit such entities into our rigid set of concepts we are painting onto the world a false impression of concreteness and meaning, which is a reflection of our concepts of ourselves.

We describe Strader VI individuals as 'attacking' one another, just as we describe microbes in the human body as doing the same. Yet the Strader colony, like the body, cannot be healthy as a whole without the 'aggressions' of its components. We describe neurons in the brain as being dumb, but brains as a whole as intelligent - but when an idea takes hold in the brain, and forces out inferior ones, do we describe this as an act of aggression? Do we mourn dead neurons?

When a philosophy, or a technology takes hold in human society... when wars are fought over them and people die... is that rightly seen as being good, or evil? This is not to undermine the meaning of our existence. From where we stand, our existence is very serious indeed. But is our civilization, and our universe, really any different from the colony on Strader VI? Is intelligence something limited to things of flesh and blood? Or is the universe truly one giant intelligent system, and we but amoeba blowing self-important potholes in its surface?

We would do well, as scientists, to remember that our goal is not to paint the world as we see it, but to see it as it truly is.",

The three of us spent days in the lifepod, rain hammering the roof, ocean on the horizon. Then the weather cleared and we saw this floating oasis. We were saved. We salvaged the Degasi wreck to build this habitat. I set Bart to studying the indigenous plantlife, finding us a stable source of food. That expensive education of his is paying dividends sooner than I expected.

Our only problem is Maida. She claims the island's too small to support us all indefinitely. Says the weather's going to turn. I say she's finding excuses to risk our lives. She's likely never gone more than a week without a physical altercation, and she's itching for a fight. Every judgement she makes assumes things go from bad to worse. If she had my experience she'd see that humans have spent millennia shackling nature to our will. This planet won't cause any new problems.

"Ency_JellyPDAObservatory" : "Bart Torgal's Log #2 - Stalker Teeth",
"EncyDesc_JellyPDAObservatory" : "Something incredible just happened.

It didn't take us long to run out of enamel. Sure, we can make all the glass we need from the quartz deposits down here, but standard glass won't cut it in an observatory that has to withstand the pressure on all sides. So I started looking for a natural substrate that would strengthen the glass we have, and those stalker teeth we've been finding fit the bill. Only we didn't have enough. That's when Marguerit got real interested. I didn't expect her to care so much, all the enamel's good for besides observing the animal life is building vehicles, and it's not like we have plans to go that far. Maybe she just found my interest in the ecosystem here infectious.

Anyway, I told her how I'd seen the stalkers hunting small fish, how the longer they go without eating the faster and more aggressive they become. She actually listened to me - more than I can say for father - so I worked up the courage to talk about my more... tentative theories. When I told her I thought they were attracted to metal deposits because they use them to sharpen their teeth she got real excited, and ran out of the room.

She came back 3 hours later with a huge cut on her forearm, and a pack full of stalker teeth! As I was helping her clean up the wound I asked her about it . She shrugged and said they're mostly harmless with a full belly. She's incredible. She went out to the kelp forests, armed with just a HEATBLADE, went fin to fin with a pack of stalkers, and then made out like it was nothing at all.

On one hand, that is the most badass thing I ever heard, and now I'm sitting in this observatory recording the behavior of the biters tapping harmlessly against the glass. On the other, I hope the stalkers didn't come off worse than Marguerit did. What's the point in surviving here if we have to kill everything that makes it wonderful?

I wish I knew more about these animals, but father won't let me get up close. Maybe with all this glass we could build a containment unit to house them?",

There's one that's 90% eyeball... Snakes twice the length of a habitat compartment.

Sure, it's not all friendly. 99% of the plantlife is toxic, I learned that the hard way, but I've managed to coax some marblemelons into growing indoors, and when they don't cover our dietary needs, well... we eat the local fish. It's a bit gross, but it's nothing they wouldn't do.

I've been attempting to document my findings. Father approves. He says we need to understand this world if we're going to take advantage of it to survive. I'm just doing it because it's fun. It's not easy without proper equipment and network access, but the old fashioned way - observing, taking notes, testing theories - let's me see the world in a way a spectroscopic analysis never could.

Lately I've been watching the crabsnakes that live down here. They ambush their prey as it tries to feed on the mushrooms they hide in. What they don't consume settles on the seabed, which fertilizes the mushrooms, which feed the herbivores, and so the chain continues. Co-evolution just blows my mind.",

Plasteel to the Federation... this family operates nine different mining colonies across the Ariadne Arm. Maida thinks she's better suited to lead? Her contract still says otherwise.

But... I just cannot damn tell whether it's the stupidest idea I ever heard, or my only hope. I turned 80 years old last week. I thought I had another 80 in me, but marooned on this planet there's no swapping out my liver when the old one fails. Here, I'm mortal. And Maida is useful to me.

So it's my responsibility to make a decision. Return to the island and hope whatever knocked the Degasi out of the sky won't do the same to the rescue ship, or take us deeper in search of answers. And all the while be hoping old age gets me before the seamonsters do.

I'll give Maida just one thing. She was right about these caves. There's enough lithium here to fabricate a hundred tons of plasteel. Enough for a damn FLEET of Cyclops submarines. There was nothing anyone could have done to avoid crashing here, but I was right to order the detour.

1. (Feeding & Digestion)
Despite its size this species subsists entirely on microorganisms it filters from the water. The mere presence of these microorganisms in such a restrictive environment is highly unlikely, depending as they do on a complicated ecosystem of plant and animal life.

2. (Reproduction)
Since just one adult specimen of this kind has been identified, it may reproduce asexually, but it may equally be the last of its kind. Large ovary-like organs are carried in the middle section, suggesting that like other species on this planet it produces eggs, however internal scar tissue indicates probable infertility.

3. (Stomach Enzyme)
The emperor is the only known source of a unique, complex enzyme which seems to play a pivotal role in protecting the ecosystem against the impacts of the bacterium. Peepers appear to have adapted to distribute the enzyme, however, its structure is unstable, and they require a constant supply to stave off uncontrollable genetic mutation.

4. (Health)
Comparative analysis of size and metabolic rates indicates this specimen is approximately 1,600 years old. Extensive internal and external scar tissue suggests it has lived well in excess of the peak lifespan for its species.

4. (Fetal Organism)

This creature likely lived and moved in small herds around the planet's ocean trenches, coming to the surface to feed off the huge volumes of microorganisms in the shallower waters. Family size would be strictly limited by available food supply. Offspring would likely split off at a young age to form their own herds elsewhere.

Given their sparse population, mating and egg-laying was likely infrequent, perhaps a once in a lifetime event. The species likely had a preferred environment for egg-laying - in fact successful hatching may depend on such conditions. Given the rarity of this event, it is impossible to calculate those conditions precisely.

There is no evidence to support the assumption that all members of the species were immune from the alien bacterium. Even if this is so, there is evidence that introduction of the bacterium decimated life on the planet, and this would have had catastrophic effects on the emperors' food supply and survival rate.
