  The
  development

  is
  constantly
  working
  on
  these
  batches.
  New
  caves
  are
  carved,
  ravines
  cut
  out,
  Kelp
  Forests
  planted,
  and
  rock
  formations
  sculpted.

  Subnautica
  is
  updated
  frequently.
  If
  Experimental
  branch
  is
  played,
  it
  is
  updated
  three
  times
  per
  day!
  Saved
  games
  need
  to
  work
  across
  multiple
  game
  versions.
  Otherwise,
  as
  soon
  as
  the
  development
  team
  released
  an
  update,
  the
  saved
  game
  would
  be
  lost.

  Most
  saved
  game
  information
  can
  survive
  an
  update.
  For
  example,
  an
  inventory
  containing
  two
  oxygen
  tanks
  can
  survive
  if
  a
  new
  type
  of
  craftable
  diving
  suit
  is
  added
  to
  the
  game.

  Other
  information
  can
  't survive an update. For example, suppose a seabase is built on a cliff, and suppose the development team works on the batch containing that cliff, raising the cliff height.

  If
  that
  save
  game
  is
  loaded,
  the
  seabase
  will
  be
  stuck
  inside
  the
  cliff.
  Not
  only
  will
  the
  base
  be
  inaccessible,
  but
  the
  player
  might
  be
  stuck
  in
  there
  too,
  and
  all
  hell
  will
  break
  loose
  inside
  Subnautica
  's game logic.

  To
  solve
  this
  problem,
  every
  saved
  game
  retains
  its
  own
  copy
  of
  terrain
  data.
  This
  data
  stores
  the
  world
  as
  it
  was
  when
  that
  game
  was
  started,
  along
  with
  any
  modifications
  made
  by
  a
  player
  (For
  example,
  digging
  sand
  to
  create
  a
  cave).

  As
  new
  updates
  are
  released,
  the
  saved
  game
  receives
  new
  features,
  items,
  creatures,
  and
  so
  on.
  But
  it
  never
  receives
  new
  terrain.
  This
  is
  often
  ok.
  In
  the
  case
  of
  major
  updates,
  it
  is
  not.

  New
  game
  systems
  and
  items
  included
  in
  this
  update
  depend
  on
  the
  data
  contained
  in
  new
  terrain
  batches.
  If
  a
  an
  old
  saved
  game
  tries
  to
  play
  current
  version,
  it
  will
  not
  work
  properly
  and
  might
  even
  crash
  Subnautica
  completely.

  This
  is
  why
  old
  saved
  games
  must
  be
  upgraded
  to
  play
  the
  game.
  Therefore
  some
  terrain
  batches
  are
  forced
  to
  update,
  allowing
  the
  new
  update
  to
  function.
  Any
  stuff
  (such
  as
  seabases)
  placed
  in
  these
  batches
  is
  destroyed
  by
  this
  process,
  to
  avoid
  the
  stuck-in-a-cliff
  scenario
  described
  above.

  However,
  the
  upgrade
  is
  not
  perfect.
  Depending
  on
  specific
  circumstances,
  it
  is
  possible
  that
  gaps
  could
  open
  up
  in
  terrain,
  or
  systems
  fail
  to
  function
  perfectly.
  In
  addition,
  the
  ugprade
  does
  not
  include
  all
  the
  new
  terrain
  data
  from
  the
  rest
  of
  the
  world.

  To
  play
  with
  an
  entirely
  up
  to
  date
  world,
  it
  is
  necessary
  to
  start
  a
  new
  game.
  The
  choice
  is
  yours.
  Regardless
  of
  your
  choice,
  thank
  you
  for
  participating
  in
  Subnautica
  Early
  Access.
  You
  are
  quite
  literally

  world
  grow
  before
  your
  eyes.
  This
  saved
  game
  upgrade
  process
  is
  a
  prime
  example
  of
  that
  growth.

  type
  of
  GPU
  is
  required
  to

- The official supplier of the TSF
- Consistently ranked amongst the Galaxy's best employers
- Began life as a defense manufacturer in the mid-22nd century
- National Motto: 'Get what you deserve'

Although most trans-govs can trace their roots back to earth, Alterra - literally meaning 'by earth' - is the only one brazen enough to take its name.

During the Expansion, Alterra supplied arms to all sides, acquiring and housing a vast colonist workforce, and making the transition from manufacturer to coprorate state. Alterra's threat to cease trade was one of the turning points in the conflict, bringing about the end of hostilities and the signing of the Charter.

Today Alterra has a ban on all weapons within its borders, although loopholes exist for law enforcement officers and manufacturers / exporters. The corporation has learnt that violence is most profitable when conducted between customers rather than employees.

Free enterprise within Alterra space is encouraged, but competition is tight, and all goods exported offworld must be Alterra branded. Profitable businesses are bought out by the state, owners ascending to the Alterra Board of Directors. Well-known Alterra technologies such as the Cyclops submersible originated with such private enterprises.

Despite superficial similarities to national governments, the corporation's lawyers have always maintained that it has no legal obligation to its 'employees', but voluntarily elects to take on the roles usually served by a democratically elected government. This claim has not yet been tested in Federation courts.",

All the good things in life are commodities. We trade love just as we buy and sell stock. We engage in human relationships when there is a fair exchange of value. Support, motivation, affection - nothing good is ever free.

If every physical good in the federation came from a single supplier it would constitute a dangerous monopoly. Personal relationships are the same: it is important for people to get what they need from multiple sources. If a person finds a better source of the goods they require, they are not wronging their original supplier by changing their purchasing arrangements.

If one member of a relationship should feel threatened or jealous, they must look at their own business model and ask whether it is performing competitively. There is always room for improvement.",

"EncyDesc_InnerBiomeWreckLore4": "Frank told us this: 'I hear there are worlds out there where kids still learn from books. They go into a classroom every day, they memorize things, then later they type those things out in controlled environments. Or worlds where everyone's supposed to whatever creative job they feel like! What use is learning to draw or sing in a world where there's no human resource department to co-ordinate the galleries and concerts? On Alterra worlds, psychometric testing and specialized digi-training makes the most of everyone's talents.'

Max Zoinkoff: 'I started out in marketing for Alterra Survival Systems. It was good work, but I thought I could do better. I set up my own company, developing bespoke code for the Seamoth so it could operate in open space, not just underwater. I sold up to Alterra ten years ago and now it's one of the most widely used vehicles in the galaxy. Now I'm on the board of directors, and I haven't looked back.'

George said, 'An average day for me starts at 10am. I live in a controlled habitat on Terra 17, so everything I need is less than five minutes away. I'm a naturally empathetic person, so I took work as a companion. I spend my days visiting clients, talking with them, learning about them, paying them the attention that everyone needs and deserves, and like most people on Alterra worlds I'm lucky enough to earn a living doing things I enjoy.'

Kaz says, 'We're lucky. We're free. We have jobs. There are trans-govs out there that do everything with robots, or where weapons are legal, you know?'

Jamie had this to say: 'I design artificial worlds, including some of the most popular factory defaults. To do what I do you need to know what people really want. They want excitement, adventure, new experiences, to be whoever they want to be. My job is to make that happen. There are people who say we spend too much time escaping our lives and not enough time making them better. Those people are usually from outside of Alterra space.'",


"Ency_InnerBiomeWreckLore5" : "Trans-Gov Profile: Mongolian Independent States",
"EncyDesc_InnerBiomeWreckLore5": "When the hostilities of the Expansion ceased, the tactical value of the hard-to-reach colony systems on the edge of the China Territories plummeted. Recouping from the war, the central government left them to starve. The systems in question declared independence, claiming their infrastructure as their own, and their intent to become self-sufficient.

Today the Mongolian States is seen as a relatively minor power on the outskirts of colonized space, yet it remains one of the fastest expanding trans-govs in the galaxy. There is little centralized control. In times of war, a defense force can be raised between the chief officers of the major planetary clan-corps.

Mongolian societies inherited their technologies from the Chinese, but incorporated the customs of their multicultural colonist base. Non-synthetic foods remain popular. Religion is a strong component of society, but the Mongolians take a relaxed view of competing faiths, believing gods to be universally and equally flawed. Mongolians will often be heard proclaiming, 'I believe in gods, so long as they don't try to command me.' If pushed to explain how they can believe in a god with no authority they will explain, simply, that all people are gods, and their authority is equally zero.",

Determinism teaches us that what has always been, always will be. The future is already decided, and free will is a myth. Gone are the days of casting guilt and original sin on all. Today we understand that we are born innocent, into lives we are not responsible for; we are atoms vibrating in the energy winds of space. Understanding that what we do has no meaning but for ourselves; and understanding that we are just as much a causal part of the universe as the universe is a causal part of us; we can understand that we give meaning to the universe and the universe gives meaning to us. We are people. But we are also gods.

If we are gods, why do we feel imperfect? If there is no authority but our own, why do people keep telling us what to do?

"Ency_OuterBiomeWreckLore4": "What Can We Learn From the Hive Mind of Strader VI?",
"EncyDesc_OuterBiomeWreckLore4": "How are the 'individuals' which make up a hive mind to be categorized? Are they merely dumb components of the larger, intelligent organism; or is the larger 'mind' merely a product of the independent organisms? Can it be both?

We define organisms by their traits, but find invariably that these traits depend on those of their environment. The concept of a tadpole is meaningless without the concept of the frog it will develop into. The idea of a predator is empty without an understanding of its prey. This begs the question: if we define everything by reference to everything else, what are have we actually explained?

An illustrative experiment was recently performed on the hive mind colony discovered on Strader VI. A device was placed outside the nest which would electrocute individuals approaching it. An ant colony would have lost many individuals before a basic danger signal was successfully communicated between them, resulting in 'learnt' avoidance of the device. Successful, but costly.

The Strader VI colony quickly formed into three factions: - One attempted to move the device by brute force, sacrificing individuals as they did so
- The second attempted to cover the device in sand.

These two goals being mutually exclusive, a fight ensued. The first faction was beaten, in virtue of their reduced numbers. The device was safely buried, and the survivors called a truce. From the perspective of the individuals, this experience must have been horrific. From the perspective of the hive mind, a nagging problem had been overcome with the most effective solution. Which perspective is the 'correct' one?

I suggest that it is neither. By attempting to fit such entities into our rigid set of concepts we are painting onto the world a false impression of concreteness and meaning, which is a reflection of our concepts of ourselves.

We describe Strader VI individuals as 'attacking' one another, just as we describe microbes in the human body as doing the same. Yet the Strader colony, like the body, cannot be healthy as a whole without the 'aggressions' of its components. We describe neurons in the brain as being dumb, but brains as a whole as intelligent - but when an idea takes hold in the brain, and forces out inferior ones, do we describe this as an act of aggression? Do we mourn dead neurons?

When a philosophy, or a technology takes hold in human society... when wars are fought over them and people die... is that rightly seen as being good, or evil? This is not to undermine the meaning of our existence. From where we stand, our existence is very serious indeed. But is our civilization, and our universe, really any different from the colony on Strader VI? Is intelligence something limited to things of flesh and blood? Or is the universe truly one giant intelligent system, and we but amoeba blowing self-important potholes in its surface?

We would do well, as scientists, to remember that our goal is not to paint the world as we see it, but to see it as it truly is.",

The three of us spent days in the lifepod, rain hammering the roof, ocean on the horizon. Then the weather cleared and we saw this floating oasis. We were saved. We salvaged the Degasi wreck to build this habitat. I set Bart to studying the indigenous plantlife, finding us a stable source of food. That expensive education of his is paying dividends sooner than I expected.

Our only problem is Maida. She claims the island's too small to support us all indefinitely. Says the weather's going to turn. I say she's finding excuses to risk our lives. She's likely never gone more than a week without a physical altercation, and she's itching for a fight. Every judgement she makes assumes things go from bad to worse. If she had my experience she'd see that humans have spent millennia shackling nature to our will. This planet won't cause any new problems.

It didn't take us long to run out of enamel. Sure, we can make all the glass we need from the quartz deposits down here, but standard glass won't cut it in an observatory that has to withstand the pressure on all sides. So I started looking for a natural substrate that would strengthen the glass we have, and those stalker teeth we've been finding fit the bill. Only we didn't have enough. That's when Marguerit got real interested. I didn't expect her to care so much, all the enamel's good for besides observing the animal life is building vehicles, and it's not like we have plans to go that far. Maybe she just found my interest in the ecosystem here infectious.

Anyway, I told her how I'd seen the stalkers hunting small fish, how the longer they go without eating the faster and more aggressive they become. She actually listened to me - more than I can say for father - so I worked up the courage to talk about my more... tentative theories. When I told her I thought they were attracted to metal deposits because they use them to sharpen their teeth she got real excited, and ran out of the room.

She came back 3 hours later with a huge cut on her forearm, and a pack full of stalker teeth! As I was helping her clean up the wound I asked her about it . She shrugged and said they're mostly harmless with a full belly. She's incredible. She went out to the kelp forests, armed with just a HEATBLADE, went fin to fin with a pack of stalkers, and then made out like it was nothing at all.

On one hand, that is the most badass thing I ever heard, and now I'm sitting in this observatory recording the behavior of the biters tapping harmlessly against the glass. On the other, I hope the stalkers didn't come off worse than Marguerit did. What's the point in surviving here if we have to kill everything that makes it wonderful?

I wish I knew more about these animals, but father won't let me get up close. Maybe with all this glass we could build a containment unit to house them?",

There's one that's 90% eyeball... Snakes twice the length of a habitat compartment.

Sure, it's not all friendly. 99% of the plantlife is toxic, I learned that the hard way, but I've managed to coax some marblemelons into growing indoors, and when they don't cover our dietary needs, well... we eat the local fish. It's a bit gross, but it's nothing they wouldn't do.

I've been attempting to document my findings. Father approves. He says we need to understand this world if we're going to take advantage of it to survive. I'm just doing it because it's fun. It's not easy without proper equipment and network access, but the old fashioned way - observing, taking notes, testing theories - let's me see the world in a way a spectroscopic analysis never could.

What they don't consume settles on the seabed, which fertilizes the mushrooms, which feed the herbivores, and so the chain continues. Co-evolution just blows my mind.",

She's got it into her head that she can save us if she just acts recklessly enough. But I've hauled starwhals to Neptune. Plasteel to the Federation... this family operates nine different mining colonies across the Ariadne Arm. Maida thinks she's better suited to lead? Her contract still says otherwise.

But... I just cannot damn tell whether it's the stupidest idea I ever heard, or my only hope. I turned 80 years old last week. I thought I had another 80 in me, but marooned on this planet there's no swapping out my liver when the old one fails. Here, I'm mortal. And Maida is useful to me.

So it's my responsibility to make a decision. Return to the island and hope whatever knocked the Degasi out of the sky won't do the same to the rescue ship, or take us deeper in search of answers. And all the while be hoping old age gets me before the seamonsters do.

I'll give Maida just one thing. She was right about these caves. There's enough lithium here to fabricate a hundred tons of plasteel. Enough for a damn FLEET of Cyclops submarines. There was nothing anyone could have done to avoid crashing here, but I was right to order the detour.

1. (Feeding & Digestion)
Despite its size this species subsists entirely on microorganisms it filters from the water. The mere presence of these microorganisms in such a restrictive environment is highly unlikely, depending as they do on a complicated ecosystem of plant and animal life.

2. (Reproduction)
Since just one adult specimen of this kind has been identified, it may reproduce asexually, but it may equally be the last of its kind. Large ovary-like organs are carried in the middle section, suggesting that like other species on this planet it produces eggs, however internal scar tissue indicates probable infertility.

3. (Stomach Enzyme)
The emperor is the only known source of a unique, complex enzyme which seems to play a pivotal role in protecting the ecosystem against the impacts of the bacterium. Peepers appear to have adapted to distribute the enzyme, however, its structure is unstable, and they require a constant supply to stave off uncontrollable genetic mutation.

4. (Health)
Comparative analysis of size and metabolic rates indicates this specimen is approximately 1, 600 years old. Extensive internal and external scar tissue suggests it has lived well in excess of the peak lifespan for its species.

3. (Amniotic Sack)
Unlike most other eggs where a nutrient supply is slowly exhausted by the embryo, these eggs exist in a form of natural stasis, likely awaiting ideal hatching conditions.

4. (Fetal Organism)
There is a high genetic match between these organisms and the leviathan in the vicinity. They appear to be stable and healthy.

Family size would be strictly limited by available food supply. Offspring would likely split off at a young age to form their own herds elsewhere.

Given their sparse population, mating and egg-laying was likely infrequent, perhaps a once in a lifetime event. The species likely had a preferred environment for egg-laying - in fact successful hatching may depend on such conditions. Given the rarity of this event, it is impossible to calculate those conditions precisely.

There is no evidence to support the assumption that all members of the species were immune from the alien bacterium. Even if this is so, there is evidence that introduction of the bacterium decimated life on the planet, and this would have had catastrophic effects on the emperors' food supply and survival rate.
